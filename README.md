# PID & PPID

A **process** is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current process' ID, you can use the system call `getpid` (man 2 `getpid`)

~~~~~
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ cat pid.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - PID
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
	pid_t my_pid;

	my_pid = getpid();
	printf("%u\n", my_pid);
	return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/c/shell$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic pid.c -o mypid && ./mypid

~~~~~

Note that the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

Each process has a parent: that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the `getppid` system call (man 2 `getppid`), from within the child process.

### Exercises
#### 0.getppid
Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does `echo $$` print the same value? why?
#### 1./proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.

## Arguments

The command line arguments are passes through the `main` function: `int main(int ac, char **av);`
* `av` is a `NULL` terminated array of strings
* `ac` is the number of items in `av`
`av[0]` usually contains the name used to invoke the current program. `av[1]` is the first argument of the program, `av[2]` the second, and so on.

### Exercises
#### 0.av
Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using `ac`.
#### 1.Read line
Write a program that prints `"$ "`, wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.

man 3 `getline`

**Important** make sure you read the man, and the RETURN VALUE section, in order to know when to stop the reading
Keyword: "end-of-file", or `EOF` (or `Ctrl+D`).

*\#advanced:*Write your own version of `getline`.
